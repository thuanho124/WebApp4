# Final Web App Project - Online Library Management System

## Note:
#### To login, please register as a new user first and then you need to use a new account to login (or it just redirects you to home page after you have signed up).

#### There is a database initializer class, please do update command or change database's name

## How it works?
#### As a librarian:
* Be able to do basic CRUD for students, and books
* Be able to issue a book and see a list of rented books, and list of overdue book.
* Be able to access to dashboard.

#### As a student (or regular user):
* Be able to find the book on the home page.
