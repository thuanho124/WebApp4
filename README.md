#### To login, please register as a new user first and then you need to use a new account to login (or it just redirects you to home page after you have signed up).

#### There is no database initializer so you dont need to update database

#### As a librarian:
* Be able to do basic CRUD for students, and books
* Be able to issue a book and see a list of rented books
 
#### Other features (may add them later):
* Check for overdue books and send an email to remind to student
* Search the book by name, ISBN, or Author.

#### If the database is not working or lost:
* Go to appsettings.json and change the database's name to thuanLibDatabase5 (the cuurrent one is LibDatabase5).
* Or change the name of database file to LibDatabase5.
* The worst way: Please add some data through student, book, and rented books page.
